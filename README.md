This full stack application is a multiplayer uno game built using React (Hooks) + Node/Express. I first developed the API and the test suite for the API to ensure it would be functioning before UI development. After completing this part fairly quickly I spent some time designing and prototyping the Front End. This proved time consuming because of the unique component structure this app required. At this moment, the Front End isn't complete however the game is in a very basic working state.

This App was made with:

* React Hooks
* GSAP (Animations)
* Node + Express
* Async/Await (cleaner async code)
* SocketIO (communication between server and clients)
* PostgreSQL (database)
* Knex (database migrations and query building)
* Mocha + Chai (testing and assertions)
